# **Diagrams as Code: Elevating Cloud Architecture with Mermaid.js**

## **Introduction**

As Cloud Engineers and Solutions Architects, we frequently move from problem statements to scalable solutions â€” using methodologies like the **Rational Unified Process (RUP)**, **Use Case Driven Design**, or **Agile Modeling**. A critical part of this journey is visualizing system architecture.

While tools like **Draw.io**, **Mural**, and **Lucidchart** have served us well, they come with limitations: diagrams become outdated, versioning is hard, and collaboration is siloed.

Enter **Mermaid.js** â€” a lightweight, open-source library that enables *Diagrams as Code*, perfectly aligning with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

Letâ€™s explore how Mermaid transforms architectural documentation and how you can start using it today â€” especially within Markdown and on GitHub.

---

## **Why Mermaid.js?**

Mermaid allows you to define diagrams using simple, readable text syntax. These diagrams are:
- Version-controlled alongside your code
- Collaboratively reviewed via pull requests
- Automatically updated with infrastructure changes
- Rendered natively in Markdown and supported on **GitHub**

This ensures documentation stays accurate, consistent, and maintainable.

## **Supported Diagram Types with Practical Examples**

### **1. Flowchart â€“ Visualizing System Workflows**

Ideal for illustrating high-level architecture flows, decision logic, or data pipelines.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Request] --> B{Authentication?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Process Request];
    B -- No --> D[Reject Access];
    C --> E[Return Response];
    D --> E;
```

> *Use Case:* Show authentication flow in a microservices API gateway.

---

### **2. Sequence Diagram â€“ Service Interactions**

Perfect for detailing real-time interactions between users, frontends, APIs, and backend services.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant API
    participant DB

    User->>Frontend: Submit Form
    Frontend->>API: POST /data
    API->>DB: Save Record
    DB-->>API: Success
    API-->>Frontend: 201 Created
    Frontend-->>User: Confirmation
```

> *Use Case:* Documenting a user signup process across layers.

---

### **3. Class Diagram â€“ Object Modeling**

Great for modeling domain entities, especially in OOP-based or backend service design.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +String name
        +String email
        +Boolean active
    }
    
    class Order {
        +String id
        +Date created
        +Float total
    }

    User "1" --> "0..*" Order : places
```

> *Use Case:* Designing a user-order relationship in an e-commerce system.

---

### **4. State Diagram â€“ State Transitions**

Useful for systems with lifecycle states (e.g., order processing, VM states).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Approved: Verify
    Pending --> Rejected: Fail Check
    Approved --> Shipped: Dispatch
    Shipped --> Delivered: Arrive
    Delivered --> [*]
```

> *Use Case:* Modeling the lifecycle of an order in a logistics system.

---

### **5. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) â€“ Database Design**

Helps visualize database schemas and relationships between tables.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string email
    }
    ORDER ||--|{ ORDER_ITEM : contains
    ORDER {
        string id
        date created
    }
    ORDER_ITEM {
        int quantity
        float price
    }
```

> *Use Case:* Documenting schema design for a new database module.

---

### **6. Gantt Chart â€“ Project Planning**

Excellent for tracking milestones, sprints, or cloud migration timelines.

```mermaid
gantt
    title Project Timeline: Cloud Migration
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Migration
    Assess Infrastructure     :a1, 2025-04-01, 14d
    Migrate Databases         :2025-04-15, 21d
    Test & Validate           :2025-05-06, 14d
    Go Live                   :2025-05-20, 1d
```

> *Use Case:* Planning and sharing a cloud migration roadmap.

---

### **7. Pie Chart â€“ Data Distribution**

Useful for showing metrics like resource usage, cost distribution, or traffic share.

```mermaid
pie
    title Traffic by Region
    "North America" : 45
    "Europe"        : 30
    "Asia"          : 15
    "Other"         : 10
```

> *Use Case:* Visualizing regional distribution of application traffic.

---

### **8. Git Graph â€“ Version Control History**

Illustrates branching strategies, CI/CD pipelines, or release workflows.

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit
   commit
   branch develop
   checkout develop
   commit
   commit
   checkout main
   merge develop
   commit
```

> *Use Case:* Explaining Git branching model (e.g., Git Flow) in team onboarding.

---

## **How to Use Mermaid in Markdown & on GitHub**

Using Mermaid in Markdown is simple. Just wrap your diagram code in a fenced code block with the `mermaid` language tag:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start] --> B[End]
```
````

### âœ… **GitHub Support**

As of 2023, **GitHub natively supports Mermaid.js** in `.md` files. This means:
- Diagrams render directly in READMEs, ADRs, or issue comments
- No external tools or preprocessing needed
- Full version control and diff tracking

> **Note**: Mermaid must be enabled in your environment. GitHub supports it by default; for local previews, use editors like **VS Code with Mermaid plugin** or **Obsidian**.

## **Benefits of Diagrams as Code**

| Benefit | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Version Control** | Track diagram changes via Git commits |
| **Collaboration** | Review diagrams in pull requests |
| **Consistency** | Avoid stale screenshots; keep docs in sync |
| **Automation** | Generate diagrams from templates or CI/CD |
| **Accessibility** | Text-based = searchable, editable, screen-reader friendly |
| **Effortless Updates** | When architecture evolves, **update the code and the diagram auto-updates** â€” no manual redrawing needed. This saves significant time and reduces errors during iterative design changes. |

ðŸ’¡ *Example:* Need to add a new service to your flowchart? Just add one line of Mermaid code â€” no clicking, dragging, or realigning shapes. The diagram renders perfectly every time.*

---

## **Conclusion**

Mermaid.js is more than a diagramming tool â€” itâ€™s a paradigm shift in how we document systems. By treating diagrams as code, we align architectural documentation with modern DevOps practices.

Whether you're designing cloud architectures, documenting microservices, or planning migrations, **Mermaid empowers you to build living, versioned, and collaborative diagrams** â€” right alongside your infrastructure.

And with the ability to **update diagrams simply by editing code**, teams save time, reduce overhead, and maintain accuracy throughout the system lifecycle.

Itâ€™s time to evolve from static images to **dynamic, code-driven visuals**.
